    I am a 19 year old frontend developer from Switzerland. <br /> <br />
    I work as an apprentice at the biggest national rail company and will
    graduate in 2019. <br /> <br />
    After finishing my apprenticeship I will work on my bachelors degree in computer science.<br /> <br />
    My focus lies in web development, but I try to keep my skill set as broad as
    possible.
